##  Time Series Analysis Project

**Project Overview:**

This project involves analyzing a time series dataset representing hourly temperature readings from an IoT device. The goal is to apply statistical methods and machine learning techniques to understand the data patterns, identify trends or seasonality, and build a model to forecast future temperatures.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
   - Import the CSV data file containing hourly temperature readings.
   - Drop unnecessary columns and rename the temperature column for clarity.
   - Set the Datetime column as the index for time-based analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Visualize the time series data to observe any trends or patterns.
   - Check for stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller test.
   - Perform seasonal decomposition to analyze trend, seasonality, and residual components.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Calculate autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) plots to identify lags with significant correlations.
   - Use these correlations to determine the appropriate values for p (autoregressive order) and q (moving average order) in the ARIMA model.

4. **ARIMA Model Selection and Fitting:**
   - Apply the Box-Jenkins method for ARIMA model selection.
   - Use the `pmdarima` library's `auto_arima()` function to automatically select the best ARIMA model based on AIC (Akaike Information Criterion).
   - Fit the selected ARIMA model to the training data.

5. **Residual Analysis:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance by analyzing the residuals (difference between actual and predicted values).
   - Check ACF and PACF plots of the residuals to ensure they fall within the confidence interval, indicating no significant autocorrelation.

6. **Forecasting and Evaluation:**
   - Generate forecasts for the validation (test) data using the fitted ARIMA model.
   - Visualize the actual and predicted temperature values for both training and validation sets.
   - Calculate performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess the model's forecasting accuracy.

**Conclusion:**

The ARIMA(1,0,0) model was found to be the most suitable for forecasting hourly temperature readings in this dataset. While the model performed well on the training data, its forecasting accuracy on the validation data was significantly lower, indicating potential limitations in generalizing to unseen data. Further investigation into data characteristics, feature engineering, and alternative modeling approaches could be explored to improve the model's predictive power.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code provided in the README is illustrative and may require adjustments based on the specific dataset and analysis requirements.
- It is important to consider factors such as data quality, outliers, and potential non-stationarity when selecting and applying statistical methods and machine learning models for time series analysis.
- Interpreting and evaluating the results of time series models should be done in conjunction with domain knowledge and an understanding of the underlying data patterns and processes.
